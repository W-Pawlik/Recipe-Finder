# Recipe-Finder
Recipe-Finder is a simple web application built using React. The main goal of this project was to reinforce fundamental skills such as:

- Fetching and manipulating API data from [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/)
- Using basic React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Creating custom hooks
- Handling errors
- Utilizing pre-built components from various libraries like React Slick and react-flags-select
- Creating a simple yet readable file structure

## Project Setup

This project was created using Create React App as it is meant for educational purposes only.

To run the application, in the project directory, run:

```bash
npm start
```

## Functionality

The application allows users to search for recipes available in TheMealDB database. There are three ways to search for a recipe:

1. Via text input
2. By selecting a letter from the alphabet
3. By selecting a country from which the desired recipes originate

### Features:
- **Saved Recipes**:  
  Users can add recipes to a saved list. The recipes are stored in the browser's local storage and displayed in the appropriate component. From there, users can either remove a recipe or view its details.

- **Custom Recipes**:  
  Users can also create their own recipes. Created recipes are stored in the browser's local storage and can be found in the recipe search feature.
